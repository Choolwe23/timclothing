# Tim Clothing Co. — Static E‑Commerce Frontend

This repository contains a responsive, front-end only static e-commerce website for the fictional brand "Tim Clothing Co.".

Features
- Mobile-first responsive design using HTML5 and CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- Pages: `index.html`, `products.html`, `product-detail.html`, `cart.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`
- Simulated shopping cart persisted in `localStorage`

How to open locally
1. Open the folder in your code editor.
2. Open any `*.html` file in a browser (Chrome/Edge) or run a simple static server.

Optional: run a quick static server with Python (if installed):

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Future work
- Improve product data management (JSON file or small CMS)
- Add more animations and accessibility improvements
- Deploy to GitHub Pages or Netlify
